## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

f <- file.choose()
f
par("mar")
boxplot(d$external.temperature)
d <- read.table(f, header = TRUE, sep =",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
head(d)
d <- d[order(-d$external.temperature),]
d[1:10]
mean(d$external.temperature)
boxplot(d$external.temperature)
boxplot(log(d$external.temperature))
barplot(d$external.temperature)
barplot(log(d$external.temperature))
hist(log(d$external.temp), freq=FALSE, col = "white", main = "My Plot with External Temp", xlab = "log(external.temp)", ylab = "location.lat", ylim = c(0,20))
hist(log(d$external.temp), freq=FALSE, col = "white", main = "My Plot with External Temp", xlab = "log(external.temp)", ylab = "location.lat", ylim = c(0,0.2))
