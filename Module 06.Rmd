## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Challenge 1##
library(curl)
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall19/Country-Data-2016.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
summary(d)
names(d)
x <-d$population
x
median(x, na.rm = TRUE)
x <-d$area
x
median(x, na.rm = TRUE)

d$density <- d$population/d$area
d <- d[order(-d$density),]
d[1:10,]

d <- d[order(d$density),]
d[1:10,]

d <- d[order(-d$population),]
d[1:20]

new <- d[grep("^[A-F]", d$country),]
summary(new)
mean(new$population, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(new$area, na.rm = TRUE)

##Challenge 2##
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
boxplot(d$population)
boxplot(log(d$population))
boxplot(d$area)
boxplot(log(d$area))
barplot(d$population)
barplot(d$area)

##Challenge 3##
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
attach(d)
hist(log(population), freq=FALSE, col = "red", main = "Plot 1", xlab = "log(population size)", ylab = "density", ylim = c(0,0.2))
hist(log(area), freq=FALSE, col = "red", main = "Plot 2", xlab = "log(area)", ylab = "density", ylim = c(0,0.2))

##Challenge 4##
