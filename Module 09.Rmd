## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

n <- 1000
x <- 856
phat <- x/n
phat
n * phat
n * (1 - phat)
pop_se <- sqrt((phat) * (1 - phat)/n)
curve(dnorm(x, mean = phat, sd = pop_se), phat - 4 * pop_se, phat + 4 * pop_se)
upper <- phat + qnorm(0.975) * pop_se
lower <- phat - qnorm(0.975) * pop_se
ci <- c(lower, upper)
polygon(cbind(c(ci[1], seq(from = ci[1], to = ci[2], length.out = 1000), ci[2]),
c(0, dnorm(seq(from = ci[1], to = ci[2], length.out = 1000), mean = phat,
sd = pop_se), 0)), border = "black", col = "gray")
abline(v = ci)
abline(h = 0)
mean(phat)
